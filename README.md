## What's Tyaprover?

**Tyaprover** is an enhanced fork of CapRover that integrates seamlessly with AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Deploy and manage your applications using natural language commands through Claude Code CLI!

Tyaprover combines the robust deployment capabilities of CapRover with cutting-edge AI integration:

✔ **AI-Powered Deployment** - Deploy apps using natural language via Claude Code CLI

✔ **MCP Server Integration** - Built-in Model Context Protocol server for AI interactions

✔ **CLI & Web GUI** - Traditional CLI/Web interface plus AI assistant control

✔ **Zero Lock-in** - Remove Tyaprover and your apps keep working (just like CapRover)

✔ **Enterprise Ready** - Docker Swarm, Nginx, Let's Encrypt under the hood

✔ **Multi-Language Support** - NodeJS, Python, PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby, MariaDB, MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, WordPress

## 🤖 AI-First Features

### Natural Language Deployment
```bash
# Traditional way
captain deploy --appName myapp --imageName node:16

# Tyaprover with AI
claude deploy myapp using node 16 image with 2GB memory
```

### Intelligent App Management
- **"Show me all my running applications"** → Lists all apps with status
- **"Deploy a new React app called portfolio"** → Creates and deploys the app
- **"Scale my API service to handle more traffic"** → Adjusts resources automatically
- **"What's wrong with my database connection?"** → Analyzes logs and suggests fixes

### Conversational DevOps
Your AI assistant can now:
- Monitor application health
- Suggest optimizations
- Troubleshoot deployment issues
- Automate routine maintenance
- Generate deployment reports

## 🚀 Quick Start with AI Integration

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Claude Code CLI (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Running Tyaprover instance

### Setup MCP Integration
1. **Configure the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server/
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Set up environment:**
   ```bash
   export TYAPROVER_API_URL="https://your-tyaprover-instance.com"
   export TYAPROVER_AUTH_TOKEN="your-auth-token"
   ```

3. **Configure Claude CLI:**
   ```bash
   claude config add-mcp-server tyaprover ./mcp-config-tyaprover.json
   ```

4. **Start deploying with AI:**
   ```bash
   claude "Deploy a new Node.js application called 'my-api' using the latest Node image"
   ```

### Traditional Installation
For standard CapRover-style installation without AI features:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock tyaprover/tyaprover
```

### Who should care about Tyaprover?

- **AI-First Developers** who want to deploy applications using natural language commands instead of complex CLI syntax
- **DevOps Engineers** looking to automate deployment workflows with conversational AI
- **Teams** that want to democratize deployment - let anyone deploy by talking to an AI assistant
- **Cost-Conscious Developers** seeking affordable alternatives to Heroku/Azure with AI superpowers
- **Modern Development Teams** who prefer writing `claude "deploy my React app"` over memorizing docker commands
- **Startups & Scale-ups** that need both simplicity and enterprise-grade reliability
